This is a workflow plugin for Goobi workflow to allow an export of an entire project. To use this a defined workflow step has to be finished and another workflow step will be finished after this export happened. The export creates an Excel file with hard coded metadata fields from the METS files as well as all images for all involved processes.

This is a plugin for Goobi workflow, the open source workflow tracking software for digitisation projects. More information about Goobi workflow is available under https://goobi.io. If you want to get in touch with the user community simply go to https://community.goobi.io.
